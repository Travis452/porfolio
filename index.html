        <p class="about">I am a Costco Supervisor, one of my friends recently introduced me to Front End Development and I've been hooked ever since.
            At Costco I've realized that I want more from a job. I want to learn more, being a developer is just that.
            I always have a passion for learning something new and never staying complacent. I have ideas and I want to learn more about software developement to bring my ideas to life and not just learn but become a great developer as well.
        </p>

        <p class="about">
            The area I am the strongest in are front end development, but i have taken courses on the back end of web development using Node.js,SQL, and MongoDB to get an understanding of the process as a whole.
            I dont have many certifications at the moment but I am currently working on more and will update this portfolio as soon as they are finsihed.

<h2 class="projects-title">Void</h2>
<p>
    Void is a personal project I am currently working on. This website is going to be for music artists, 
    typically when you make music you end up with a bunch of unfinished projects that you may never use again and now they're just sitting in your folder
     untouched when maybe someone else could use that project that you made and put it to good use. Void will be a social media app for just that the artist
      will be able to upload the project/projects they dont like or know they aren't going to do anything with to the page where other artists can download
       said projects and put them to good use. This project is being developed using React and will be implementing Firebase.

<h2 class="projects-title"> Ecommerce Website </h2>

<p>
   This is a project that I ended up doing for my friend and his company BlindOath. 
   I told him that his design was a little all over the place so I made a much more simple UI, 
   that was easy to navigate, using React.
